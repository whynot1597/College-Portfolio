The only file we modified was myTeam.py. This produces a file name weights_jj.txt which contains a JSON object of the weights for all of the features.

To get these weights, we ran our team with the TRAINING flag on in 10 games.

We only use libraries that are a part of the Python standard library.

We ran this on Python version 3.7.4.
