# Group Retrospective - Group 2

## Instructions
Reflect on your overall group database stack work for the semester in a `group-retrospective.md` document. Describe what each group member worked on through all of the database mini-stack assignments as well as this last full SDK

## Reponse
Our group worked on everything together. Rather than split up and work on seperate parts, we decided that the best way to make sure everyone had an understanding of what was going on was to work on the same thing together. We utilized VS Code's liveshare feature so everyone could write, edit, and execute code instead of having one person code while everyone watched. If at any point someone was unsure about what was happening, that person was quickly filled in. We rotated who took command of creating the query to make sure everyone got the chance to get experience working with the code. However, if the person needed help, the group was happy to supply it. In that respect, it is hard to label who did what because everyone was involved in everything.
