This is very nice!  You guys obviously put some effort into this, not only
for the document and information, but also to get it to look good in GitHub
markdown!  GREAT!

Your functional requirements are wonderful!  The different subsections have
about the right amount of requirements for each part.

One area that could be expanded is the Server section, where a *little* more
could be added.  For example:

5.3.3.1 - The server section shall examine user textboxes to ensure valid data.

what is meant by "valid" data?  How many textboxes exist?  Is the requirement
saying that the server will examine ANY text box?  How will it know which of
the data are correct for which text box?

You can see what I mean.....

The performance and environment requirements sections are perfect!  Good job!

Re-visit this document during the semester a couple of times and fill out a
little more "stuff" for the functional requirements and you'll have the full
credit for both submissions!
